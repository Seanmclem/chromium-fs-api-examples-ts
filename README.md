## File System Access API

This project acts as a bit of a tech-demo of Chromium's new native file system API which they call the "File System Access API". There have been previous attempts to standardize a native file system API for browsers, but they were not fully adopted and mostly deprecated.

This API is one I have been waiting for. As it will help bridge the last gaps between native apps and web apps.

My aim for this project is to stay close to this new spec, and become very familiar with it. I'd like to build out utility functions for common file system interactions. These would be as generic and framework agnostic as possible. I will probably use this project as the basis for other new projects that use the new API.

This new File System Access API, at time of writing, is only supported in more recent non-mobile Chromium based browsers. It has been available in the stable channel for a while. It does not work in Firefox, Safari, or any mobile browsers. Only browsers like, Chrome, Edge, Brave, and other Chromium based browsers.
